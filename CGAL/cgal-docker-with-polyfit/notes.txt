CMake Error at 3rd_QGLViewer-2.6.3/CMakeLists.txt:25 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindQt5OpenGL.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "Qt5OpenGL", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Qt5OpenGL" with
  any of the following names:

    Qt5OpenGLConfig.cmake
    qt5opengl-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Qt5OpenGL" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Qt5OpenGL_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "Qt5OpenGL" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.

-DQt5OpenGL_DIR:PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/Qt5OpenGLExtensions/
